# Karni’s Crap Filter

Karnifex finally got tired of looting 8 copper Fish Scales and accepted the quest to figure out how to never do it again. Thus, Karni’s Crap Filter was born. It automatically loots what you want and skips what you don’t want, saving bag space for good stuff like hookers and weapons. It’s also a robust, full-featured and (hopefully) easy to use auto loot system!
